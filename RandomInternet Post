I don't understand this assumption that women have their pick of men. Are we assuming that men are always on the prowl but are only sometimes successful at getting laid, whereas women, at any given time, have multiple possibilities but choose to "empower" themselves? Would that it were so!

Another person weighing in on male vs female sexuality...

I don't think that men are sex mad, but for us sex is a simple, free act, that is more enjoyable with a hot girl, but is pretty good with just about anyone.
We don't get why women need to be convinced / seduced into sex (and this is true even for one-night stands -- they don't normally proceed from "Hey, wanna have sex?").

Women OTOH can sleep with just about anyone they want.
However, they don't often perceive themselves as the selectors. I suspect that this is because women are attracted to guys who act like selectors themselves. If a guy's surrounded by girls, he becomes desirable to other women.
So, as a simplification, women like guys they feel they can't easily have.

Women aren't supposed to enjoy sex. Men are.

To elaborate on this, think about the word "empowerment" as being about choice.

How does a woman traditionally exercise sexual choice? By being "choosy" about who she has sex with. Not having sex with anyone is the ultimate in being choosy. Thus, solo sex is seen as empowering because it is an expression of sexual choice. It's no longer about "giving" sex to guys who may not satisfy you sexually (and all of this is very mixed up with the idea that women do not normally enjoy sex) but about "taking" that pleasure for yourself.

How do men traditionally exercise sexual choice? By having a variety of potential partners to choose from. It's assumed that a man will always prefer a human partner if they have access to one, and thus using a toy is seen as a sign that you are unable to attract a partner.
